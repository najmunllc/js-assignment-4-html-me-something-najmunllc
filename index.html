                   <h2><i>Name</i>Your Business</h2>
                   <p>
                       Naming your business is one of the most important steps taken when starting a new business. Names should be 
                       <ul>
                        <li><b>Short</b></li>
                        <li><b>Memorable</b></li>
                        <li><b>Associated With Your Company(Brand)</b></li>
                        <p>Since your domain name can have a major impact on your online presence, what you choose is a vital first step in building your brand. Finding the perfect domain name, however, can be challenging.

                            While it’s true that there are millions of domain names available, many of the popular domain names that are easy to remember are taken. Fortunately, you can still get what you need if you go through a simple process and use a bit of imagination.</p>

                   <p> There are many platforms to complete a name search for the "intended" name of your business.  One of the more popular websites is Godaddy. <abbr title="Godaddy Website"> <a href="https://www.godaddy.com/">GW</a></abbr></p>
                   <h3> <b>Types</b> of Domains</h3>
                   <div class="funParagraph">
                    <p id="testP">According to Verisign, there were over 360 million registered domains in 2019. The types you can buy vary greatly. To make the best choice, you need to first understand the anatomy of a domain, which is made of two main parts — a second-level domain (SLD) and a top-level domain (TLD).</p>
                   </div>
                  
                   <ol type="I">
                       <li><b>Second-Level Domains</b> A second-level domain is what most people think of when they think of the name of a website. It’s the unique name that you choose to represent your brand because it’s the part that people will remember the most.

                        In a web address, an SLD appears just to the left of the extension, or top-level domain. It can contain as many letters, numbers, and special characters as you want, but it’s best to keep them short and easy.
                       </ol>

                   <ol type="II">
                       </li><b>Top-level domains (TLDs)</b> are also referred to as domain extensions. They’re the series of letters that appear at the right of your SLD, after the dot. The most popular ones include:
                       </ol>
 
                        </ul>
                        <ol type="1">
                            <li><b>.com</b>: Short for “commercial,” this was the first TLD launched, initially meant for business and commercial use. It’s still the most popular.</li>
                            <li><b>.net</b>: Short for “network,” this was created for technology organizations, but it has become another common option for business website owners of all types.</li>
                            <li><b>.org</b>: Short for “organization,” this was developed for non-profit organizations but soon became popular among schools, communities, and for-profit enterprises.</li>
                        </ol>

                   <h2><i>Purchase</i> Your Available Domain</h2>
                   <ul>
                       <li><b>Cost</b> of a domain</li>
                       <p>When you buy a domain name through domain registrars, you register it for one year with the option of a multi-year registration. You will be able to renew your domain name registration when the initial period finishes, and will usually be alerted by the registrar to do so. Domain names are also sometimes included in your web hosting plan and if not, usually offered by your hosting company. A domain name with a common top-level domain, such as .com, can be had for as low as $12.99 per year, and promotions are often available.</p>
                       <li><b>Avoid</b> Numbers and Hyphens</li>
                       <p>Imagine asking your 10 friends to spell or pronounce a domain name filled with numbers and dashes. It won’t work.

                        If you choose a domain name with these elements, you’re likely going to lose traffic to people who can’t remember your domain or effectively tell someone else how to find it. We probably wouldn’t have Facebook today if you had to go to Face-Book.com to reach the site.</p>
                        <li><b>Your Future</b> So Secure It</li>
                        <p>Domains and websites are long-term investments. That means you should avoid choosing a domain name that includes a year or the latest trendy catchphrase.

                            Think about where your business or brand might be in five or ten years. If you provide basic SEO services now, you might end up expanding your offerings as your business grows. So, using the words “marketing” or “digital marketing” might be better descriptors than “SEO services.”</p>

                <h2><i>What Type</i> of Business Do You Want</h2>
                   <p> There are many factors that go into choosing what TYPE of business you want to start.
                       <ul>
                           <li><b>Budget</b> It’s important to plan out your budget upfront to ensure you’re able to properly fund your business idea. Start by analyzing your current financial situation and how much money it will take to get the business started. Consider the actions you’ll take to raise additional funds, whether it’s attracting investors, applying for capital or fundraising.

                            Next, create a financial plan to map out exactly what it will cost to run your new business successfully. For example, if you’re opening up a brick-and-mortar store, consider the costs of furniture, rent and other expenses necessary to open and run your business.</li>

                            <li><b>Scalability</b> It’s important to consider a future business’s scalability. Here are a few questions to consider when thinking about whether your business idea can grow efficiently and sustainably:
                              <ul>
                                  <li>Does your business idea meet ongoing customer demand?</li>
                                  <li>Can you consistently duplicate the product or service multiple times?</li>
                                  <li>Will the idea meet customer needs and standards as the business grows?</li>
                                  <li>Does your idea have to be constantly reevaluated or adjusted over time?</li>

                              </ul>
                              <p>If you answer <b><i>"NO"</i></b> to these questions, this may be a sign your business idea won’t be easy to scale.</p>
                            </li>
                            </li><b>Market size and demand</b> Starting a business requires research into your target market or your business’s ideal audience and consumer base. Consider how your business can uniquely solve your customer’s problem. Ask yourself what they would do without your product or service.

                            This is also an ideal time to research your competition and learn why consumers are drawn to services other than yours. Additionally, examine if your business idea has enough demand to become profitable. It can be difficult to break into a market with more competition than demand.</li>

                            <li><b>Your industry expertise</b> It’s important to have a basic foundation of knowledge to start a business. It also helps to have a certain expertise in your business idea before launching. Start by researching business resources and the competition to see if your business idea is feasible in the current market.

                                Next, brush up on your knowledge of the industry your business idea is in. Brainstorm how you can contribute to this industry and how your unique viewpoint can impact the consumers in the industry. Additionally, make the time to take relevant courses and classes or hire a consultant to assist you in the business process. You can even obtain a degree or certificate in your target industry to add credibility.</li>

                            <li><b>Your passion and interest</b> Every great business idea comes from either an interest or a passion for that particular idea, service or product. Passion and persistence is crucial, as starting a business comes with late nights, fear of failure and multiple obstacles along the way. Ensure that the people you’re working with are in it for the long haul through a mutual desire to pursue this business idea. If you start your business with an idea you’re passionate about or interested in, it can sustain you through difficult times.</li>

                <h2><i>Choose</i> Your Hosting Platform</h2>
                   <p>Teaming up with the right web hosting service is more important than you think. It’s a partnership. Opt for the wrong one and you could find yourself struggling to get support, suffering downtime or worse. The loss the initial capital investment can be dwarfed by the damage that a bad web hosting can do. Choosing a hosting package needn’t be a chore though, just consider these points below during your research phase and you’ll find the choice of plan becomes much clearer.
                       <ul>
                           <li><b>What is the Hosting Site Offering</b> Ask yourself all these questions and more. Whether it be shared hosting(opens in new tab), VPS hosting(opens in new tab), dedicated hosting(opens in new tab), or managed hosting(opens in new tab), look at the pros and cons of all. Ask yourself what you need it to do and don’t be afraid to ask for advice.</li>
                           <li><b>Support Services Offered</b> Make sure that the support you are looking for takes place on multiple channels. Likely, you will not always be able to pick up the phone and call, so make sure your selected hosting provider has chat, email and other means of communications.</li>
                           <li><b>Features</b> Functionality is important for any website and so is future-proofing. As your website grows and with it the amount of space you need, does the hosting company have the capacity and the features to allow for growth?</li>
                           <li><b>Server Locations</b> Resource heavy websites, large scripts and even WordPress themes all influence how fast a site can load. These factors play an important role in website performance and load times as well. And for the environmentally friendly, a few providers off green data centers. </li>
                           <li><b>What Specializations are Provided</b> By far and away WordPress dominates the internet.  Several hosting providers have packages and plans dedicated to WordPress hosting(opens in new tab). If your website’s content management system is WordPress then you should look closely at managed WordPress hosting plans. That said, there are several other content management systems (CMS(opens in new tab)) besides WordPress and if you’d like to keep your options open look for hosts that offer more than one CMS.</li>
                           <li><b>Security</b> Depending on the nature of your business you may have higher standards to meet in terms of security. Will this hosting company meet these expectations? Or would another be better equipped? And, are SSL certificates included.</li>
                           <li><b>Price and Customers Feedback</b> Research the company itself and the services they provide. While you are more likely to find negative reviews about a company, what previous users have issue with may give indication as to whether you want to trust the hosting company with your website.</li>
                       </ul>
